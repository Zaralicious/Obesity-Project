Obesity is a serious and chronic disease with genetic and environmental 
interactions. It is defined as an excessive amount of fat tissue in the body 
that is harmful to health. The main risk factors for obesity include social, 
psychological, and eating habits. Obesity is a significant health problem 
for all age groups in the world. Currently, more than 2 billion people 
worldwide are obese or overweight. Research has shown that obesity can 
be prevented. In this study, artificial intelligence methods were used to 
identify individuals at risk of obesity. An online survey was conducted on 
1610 individuals to create the obesity dataset. To analyze the survey data, 
four commonly used artificial intelligence methods in literature, namely 
Artificial Neural Network, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and 
Support Vector Machine, were employed after pre-processing. As a result 
of this analysis, obesity classes were predicted correctly with success rates 
of 74.96%, 74.03%, 74.03% and 87.82%, respectively.
